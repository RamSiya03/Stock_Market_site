                <p>A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks
                    (also
                    called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed
                    on a
                    public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private
                    companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually
                    made
                    with an investment strategy in mind.
                    Bonus shares are additional shares given to the current shareholders without any additional cost,
                    based upon the number of shares that a shareholder owns. These are company's accumulated earnings
                    which are not given out in the form of dividends, but are converted into free shares.
                    Which is better dividend or bonus shares?
                    Dividends are paid to shareholders in the form of cash which gets credited to your registered bank
                    account (linked to Demat account), while bonus issues are paid in additional shares. As a result, it
                    increases the value of its stock, making it more enticing to investors.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Stock exchange</h3>
                <p>A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares
                    (equity stock), bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a
                    stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The
                    exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded "over
                    the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on
                    more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.[4]

                    Stock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed-interest securities (bonds)
                    or (less frequently) derivatives, which are more likely to be traded OTC.

                    Trade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a
                    seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. Equities (stocks or shares)
                    confer an ownership interest in a particular company.

                    Participants in the stock market range from small individual stock investors to larger investors,
                    who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies, pension funds
                    and hedge funds. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange
                    trader.

                    Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a
                    method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodities exchanges,
                    and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network
                    of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ.

                    A potential buyer bids a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller asks a specific price
                    for the same stock. Buying or selling at the Market means you will accept any ask price or bid price
                    for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served
                    basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.

                    The purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and
                    sellers, thus providing a marketplace. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the
                    listed securities, facilitating price discovery.</p>
